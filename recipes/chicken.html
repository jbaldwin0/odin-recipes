    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour salad dressing into a large resealable plastic bag. 
            Add chicken breasts, seal bag, and shake to coat. Marinate in the 
            refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight (the longer you marinate, 
            the more flavor the chicken will absorb).
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from marinade and place in a lightly greased 9x13-inch 
            baking dish; discard remaining marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven, turning chicken occasionally, until cooked 
            through and juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
